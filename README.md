# Inventor Library
## [Latest Release: 1.3.0](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor/releases/latest)

This library includes every length of metal, commonly used cut metal, construction circles for ease of constraining, and parametric hardware.  

Library 1.3 is a quality of life update including consistent file names, more sizing tools, improved shafts, smooth screws, improved chain generator, and new part releases from the past year (flex wheels, sensors, HS hardware, Robosource shoulder screws, 2.5" screws, etc). It is **NOT** compatible with previous versions.

### [Parts Library Download](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor/releases/latest)
The recommended file structure is to have a CAD folder anywhere on your computer, and place the [latest release](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor/releases/latest) in this folder. Every new robot you create will be a new folder in the CAD folder.
