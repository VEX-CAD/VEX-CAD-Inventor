# Inventor Library
## [Latest Release: 1.4.1](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor/releases/latest)

This library includes every length of metal, commonly used cut metal, construction circles for ease of constraining, and parametric hardware.  

The VEX CAD team is also proud to announce the release of version 1.4.1 of the Inventor library! The latest version fixes issues with the 1.4.0 release as well as other minor changes. It is compatible with 1.4.0, but **NOT** any previous versions.

### [Parts Library Download](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor/releases/latest)
The recommended file structure is to have a CAD folder anywhere on your computer, and place the [latest release](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor/releases/latest) in this folder. Every new robot you create will be a new folder in the CAD folder.
